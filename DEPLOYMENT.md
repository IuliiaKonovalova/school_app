1. Install the dependencies:

    - Open the terminal window and type:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project where you should add env.py and __pycache__ files to prevent the privacy of your secret data.

1. Create a `.env` file. This will contain the following environment variables:

    ```python
    import os

      os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'Add a secret key'
      os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'will be used to connect to the database'
      os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
    ```

    *During the development stage DEBUG is set to True, but it is vital to change it to False.*

1. Run the following commands in a terminal to make migrations: 
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
1. Create a superuser to get access to the admin environment.
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Enter the required information (your username, email and password).
1. Run the app with the following command in the terminal:
    - `python3 manage.py runserver`
1. Open the link provided in a browser to see the app.

1. If you need to access the admin page:
    - Add /admin/ to the link provided.
    - Enter your username and password (for the superuser that you have created before).
    - You will be redirected to the admin page.


**The app was initially deployed to Heroku then moved to Render since Heroku has removed its free tier services from November 29 2022**

## Heroku Deployment

* Set up a local workspace on your computer for Heroku:
    - Create a list of requirements that the project needs to run:
      - type this in the terminal: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
    
* Go to [www.heroku.com](www.heroku.com)Â 
* Log in or create a Heroku account.
* Create a new app with any unique name <name app>.

  ![Heroku. Create New App](documentation/deployment/new_heroku_app.png)

* Create a Procfile in your local workplace:

  ![Heroku. Procfile](documentation/deployment/heroku_procfile.png)
    
    This file will will contain the following:
    ```python
        web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application
    ```
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

* Go to resources in Heroku and search for postgresql. Select Hobby dev - Free and click on the provision button to add it to the project.

  ![Heroku. Postgres](documentation/deployment/heroku_postgres.png)

* Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to Config Vars.

  ![Heroku. Settings](documentation/deployment/settings_tab.png)

Click on Reveal Config Vars and add the following config variables:

| Key      | Value          |
|-------------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | ... | 
| DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | ... |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | ... |
| HEROKU_HOSTNAME | ... |
| SECRET_KEY | ... |


* Copy the value of DATABASE_URL and input it into the .env file and generate a secret key (you may use [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) for secret key generation).
* Create EMAIL_HOST_PASS and EMAIL_HOST_USER with a gmail account and add values to these keys.
* Migrate changes.
* Set debug to False in settings.py
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
* Connect your repository to Heroku.

  ![Heroku. Connect to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_connect_github.png)

* Deploy the app to Heroku by clicking "Deploy Branch" button. If you want to enable auto-deployment, click "Enable Automatic Deployment".

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploy_branch.png) 


The deployment process will start.

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploying.png) 

Click "View build logs" to see the progress of the deployment.

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploying_view.png)


*Due to security updates, Heroku dashboard will not allow you to deploy your app from GitHub. Thus, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:*

| action | terminal command | comment |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| login to your heroku account | `heroku login -i` | |
| create a new app on heroku | `heroku create NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you haven't created the app before, and then, you can access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.|
| add remote to your local repository | `heroku git:remote -a NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you have already created app on Heroku (before the security updates) and connected it using Heroku dashboard |
| deploy new version of the app | `git push heroku main` | |
| rename app | `git remote rename NAME-OF-YOUR-APP NAME-OF-YOUR-APP-2` | |

**Final Deployment**

* Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
