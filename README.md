  ![Profile delete page](documentation/features/delete_lesson_page/cancel_delete_buttons.png)


**Lesson Detail Page**

This page is accessible by each member of the school.

  ![Lesson Detail Page](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_detail_page.png)

The lesson table has a different look for the users. 

School personnel except receptionists looks as follows:

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Personnel View](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_detail_personnel.png)

It has the name of the subject as a title:

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Subject](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_subject.png)

Under the name of the subject, there is a table with the data on the lesson:

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Personnel View](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_data.png)

This table allows users to learn which subject is given, on which day, and in which period of time. This will be beneficial to the users plan their personal schedules.
Moreover, it has a row which shows who is teaching this subject and a row on the students which will attend the class.

However, when it comes to the users, who are parents of potential clients, the table looks a bit differently:

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Parent View](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_detail_parent.png)

As it may be noticed, a parent may access only their own children's profiles. The rest of the students have no link to this parent.

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Parent View. Students' Links](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_detail_parent_links.png)

When it comes to the receptionists, they have additional functionality available, and thus, the lesson table looks differently:

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Receptionist View](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_detail_receptionist.png)

It has 2 button in the top right corner of the table: "edit" and "delete".

  ![Lesson Detail Page. Receptionist View. Buttons](documentation/features/lesson_detail_page/lesson_edit_delete_buttons.png)

If the receptionist clicks on the "Delete" button, he/she will be redirected to the Lesson Delete Page. If the user receptionist on the "Edit" button, he/she will be redirected to Lesson Edit Page.

**Error Pages**

There are also 2 additional error pages:

  ![Error Page. 404](documentation/features/error_page/404_error_page.png)

  it has a box with the header "Page 404", an image and a short message about the error ("Something went wrong as this page is not found").

  If the user is logged in and tries to access a page that doesn't exist, he/she will find a button with the link to his/her profile page.

  ![Error Page. 404. Link to user profile](documentation/features/error_page/404_error_page2.png)

  If the user is logged out and tries to access a page that doesn't exist, he/she will find a button with the link to the home page

  ![Error Page. 404. Link to home page](documentation/features/error_page/404_error_page1.png)

  Page 505 is the same as 404 page, but it has a different header ("Page 500") and message ("Something went wrong as there is an internal sever error!").

  ![Error Page. 500](documentation/features/error_page/500_error_page.png)

**Favicon**

  ![Favicon](documentation/features/favicon/favicon.png)

  The favicon is a small image that is displayed in the browser's address bar. It is used to identify the website among others and help the user to find it when he/she is searching for it.

## Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. Thus, all the components are designed to be easy to use. The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of focus. As this application is a multifunctional one and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. 

### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the application is based on the bold colors:

  ![Color Scheme](documentation/design/color_palette.png)

As it may be noticed, the color scheme is based on the Material Design principles as well. The navbar is green with dark blue text. The background is white with light blue waves, which are almost invisible. There is a dark blue button to guide the user on how to find the menu.
The footer is a dark blue with white text to stand out.

Since the main content has various functions, two different colors were used as the background for the main boxes. The first one is #001D82, which is the color of the navbar text. The decision to use this color for the login/logout/register boxes was made as it shows that the user isn't logged in.
The #93D3FD is the color of the data boxes. This color is consistent with the color scheme throughout the whole application. In addition to this, the blue color is believed to be the preferred color among people and facilitates trust and security.

All buttons except the navbar button are green with the white text editing and cancel functionality and orange for the submission and deletion function.
### Typography

The main font used in the application is Lato. The use of this font is consistent with the color scheme. Needless to say, the Lato font was chosen due to its readability, which increases user experience.

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_400.png)

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_700.png)

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_900.png)

To emphasize the importance of the text, the font-weight was set to 900. To make the accent on the buttons, the font-weight was set to 700. For the rest of the text, the font-weight was set to 400.

### Imagery

- The main background image was generated with the user of the [BGJar](https://www.bgjar.com/) tool. The image was generated with the following settings:

  ![Background](documentation/design/background.svg)

To generate this particular pattern, I used Contour Line Generator with white background and #93D3FD54 as the color of the lines. 

- Images were downloaded from the [icons8](https://icons8.com/) website only for the home page. However, the original images were changed manually to match the color scheme.

- The main part is allocated to the use of icons from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. The use of icons is essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

## Information Architecture

### Database

* During the earliest stages of the project, the database was created using SQLite.
* The database was then migrated to PostgreSQL.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

* The ERD was created using [Draw.io](https://www.lucidchart.com/).

- [Database Scheme](documentation/diagrams/db_final.pdf)

### Data Modeling

1. **CustomUser**

Extends Allauth's User model.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| UserName      | username      | CharField     |  max_length=50, blank=False, null=True, unique=True    |
| Email         | email         | EmailField    | max_length=50, unique=True, blank=False, null=False    |
| First Name    | first_name    | CharField     | max_length=30, blank=False, null=False    |
| Last Name     | last_name     | CharField     | max_length=30, blank=False, null=False    |
| Phone Number  | email         | CharField     | max_length=30, blank=False, null=False    |
| Role          | phone         | IntegerField  | choices=ROLES, default=5    |


```Python
    # Roles to assign to users
    ROLES = (
        (0, 'boss'),
        (1, 'teacher'),
        (2, 'sales'),
        (3, 'receptionist'),
        (4, 'parent'),
        (5, 'potential user'),
    )
```

2. **Teacher**

It was created in order to provide more room for manipulation of the database and provide opportunities for future developments. Users with the role of teacher will be automatically assigned to this table.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Teacher       | user          | ForeignKey    |  CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE  |

3. **Receptionist**

It was created in order to provide more room for manipulation of the database and provide opportunities for future developments.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Receptionist  | user          | ForeignKey    |  CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE  |

4. **SalesManager**

It was created in order to provide more room for manipulation of the database and provide opportunities for future developments. Users with the role of sales manager will be automatically assigned to this table.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Sales Manager | user          | ForeignKey    |  CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE  |
| Sales Total   | total_sold    | IntegerField  |  default=0, blank=True, null=True  |

5. **Parent**

It was created in order to provide more room for manipulation of the database and provide opportunities for future developments. Users with the role of the parent will be automatically assigned to this table.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Sales Manager | user          | ForeignKey    |  CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE  |
| Relation to a student  | relation      | IntegerField  |  choices=GUARDIAN_RELATION, default=5  |

```Python
    # Guardian's relation to the student
    GUARDIAN_RELATION = (
        (1, 'father'),
        (2, 'mother'),
        (3, 'grandfather'),
        (4, 'grandmother'),
        (5, 'other'),
    )
```
6. **Student**

This table does not inherit from the CustomUser model. This is because the students are not users. Instead, they are the main table of the application.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| First Name         | first_name    | CharField       | max_length=50, blank=False, null=False    |
| Last Name          | last_name     | CharField       | max_length=50, blank=False, null=False    |
| Parents            | parent        | ManyToManyField | Parent, related_name='child'  |
| Birthday           | birthday      | DateField       |          |

| Notes              | notes         | TextField       | blank=True    |

7. **Sales**

This table is needed to conduct sales operations. It controls the sales of the products. It also adds classes to a particular student and adds total classes sold to a sales manager. A separate field "student_id" was added in order to prevent a circular import but allow sales to be in control of classes added to a particular student or reduced (For example, when parents ask for a refund).

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Sales Manager | sold_by       | ForeignKey    | SalesManager, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='sold'   |
| Client(Parent)| sold_to       | ForeignKey    | Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='bought'   |
| Classes Number| amount        | IntegerField  |            |
| Date of Sale  | date          | DateTimeField | auto_now_add=True    |
| Student       | amount        | IntegerField  |  default=0          |

8. **Lesson**

This table is necessary to control the lessons and provide data for the schedule.

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type     | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Class's Date  | date          | DateField      |            |
| Class's Time  | time          | IntegerField   | choices=TIME_PERIODS, default=0 |
| Subject       | subject       | IntegerField   | choices=SUBJECTS, default=1     |
| Teachers      | teachers      | ManyToManyField| Teacher, related_name='lessons' |
| Students      | students      | ManyToManyField| Student, related_name='lessons' |


```Python
    # Time periods variations
    TIME_PERIODS = (
        (0, '9:00-9:45'),
        (1, '10:00-10:45'),
        (2, '11:00-11:45'),

*Due to security updates, Heroku dashboard will not allow you to deploy your app from GitHub. Thus, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:*

| action | terminal command | comment |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| login to your heroku account | `heroku login -i` | |
| create a new app on heroku | `heroku create NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you haven't created the app before, and then, you can access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.|
| add remote to your local repository | `heroku git:remote -a NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you have already created app on Heroku (before the security updates) and connected it using Heroku dashboard |
| deploy new version of the app | `git push heroku main` | |
| rename app | `git remote rename NAME-OF-YOUR-APP NAME-OF-YOUR-APP-2` | |

**Final Deployment**

* Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
